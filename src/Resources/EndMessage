Great work gaining access to Coach Marlowe's computer. His emails reveal that someone going by the name as "The Galloping Ghost" has threatened his family's safety,
instructing him to meet in the locker room. This is a crucial lead. Well, that's all for now. Will you resume your role as Detective Jack 'The Shadow' Malone and
solve the case of the missing coach?

Thanks for Playing!
